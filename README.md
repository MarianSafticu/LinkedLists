# LinkedLists
this are some linked list implementations

I used raw pointers to begin with even if they are unsafe to learn some memory managemant, and because of
that i didn't throw exceptions, in exchange in case of invalidity i either did nothing or i returned some
values to know when an operation did't work , or that some data are invalid
	LinkedList is a simple linked list
	DLinkedList is a double linked list
	SLinkedList is a skip linked list
